### FAQ: Why is there no code?
The CS61B staff would not let me post the code for this game in a public repository. They did, however, let me post a video of my finished word.

### FAQ: I am on CS61B staff at UC Berkeley. When did we allow you to post this video?
CS 61B Spring 2023 EdStem Discussion Post \#8118d, Jeddidiah Tsang and Justin Yokota said it was okay.
